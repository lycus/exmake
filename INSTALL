            == ExMake: Modern Scriptable Make ==

                -- Installation --

ExMake can be built, tested, and installed by invoking a number of Make
targets. Though the build process uses Mix, you should avoid invoking it
directly as doing so can interfere with the build.

The available makefile targets are:

    * all: Runs ebin and escript. This is the default target.
    * ebin: Builds all ExMake modules.
    * escript: Builds the escriptized ExMake binary. Runs ebin if needed.
    * test: Runs the ExMake test suite. Runs ebin if needed.
    * dialyze: Runs Dialyzer on compiled ExMake modules. Runs ebin if needed.
    * clean: Cleans up the tree (removes compiled modules).
    * install: Install ExMake to PREFIX. Runs escript if needed.
    * uninstall: Remove ExMake from PREFIX.

By default, the install and uninstall targets set PREFIX to /usr/local. The
PREFIX variable can be set on the Make command line to install to a different
location.

A number of variables can be set in the environment to override the tools used
by the makefile:
 
    * INSTALL The POSIX install utility.
    * MIX: The Mix build tool shipped with Elixir.
    * DIALYZER: The Dialyzer tool from the Erlang suite.

You should not normally have to override these if the tools are present in
your environment.

To get an escript:

    $ make escript

This places the escript named exmake in the _build/shared/lib/exmake/ebin
directory. It is completely self-contained so it can be moved anywhere and will
run fine provided the host system it is run on has Erlang installed.

It's a good idea to run the test suite before using ExMake:

    $ make test

If this passes, you should be good to go.
