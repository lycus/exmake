            == ExMake: Modern Scriptable Make ==

                -- Compatibility --

ExMake requires Erlang R16B+ and Elixir 0.10.4+. You will also need GNU Make
and basic POSIX utilities to build.

ExMake should generally run on any operating system and architecture that the
Erlang virtual machine runs on.
