                -- Contributing --

Contributed code is expected to follow the established code style. See
the STYLE file for that.

A test case for a change should almost always be included unless it is
problematic to test. In such cases, please explain why in a commit
message. You are also expected to run the test suite and verify that no
regressions have been caused by your changes before submitting them. It
might be a good idea to set up a Dialyzer PLT so you can run Dialyzer
on your changes.

Please avoid sending unrelated patches in the same review/patch series.

All contributed code will go through the review process as described on
the Lycus wiki: https://github.com/lycus/lycus.github.com/wiki/Review-Process

Note that all code contributed to ExMake must be licensed under the terms
found in the LICENSE file. Additionally, copyright must be assigned to
the Lycus Foundation when submitting contributions. The project
maintainers reserve the right to alter the license at any point in time,
should this ever become necessary.
