            == ExMake: Modern Scriptable Make ==

                -- Introduction --

ExMake is a scriptable, dependency-based build system loosely based on the
principles behind the POSIX Make utility program. It is intended to be a
full replacement for Make, with much better scripting support and more
familiar syntax based on the Elixir programming language.
